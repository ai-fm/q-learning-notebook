    "## Deep Q-Learning in Pytorch\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first notebook, we used (standard, tabular) Q-learning on two gymnasium environments. When we combine Q-learning with neural networks to represent the policy, the resulting algorithm is called DQN (Deep Q-learning). DQN is one of the most fundamental and simple algorithms in DRL. Please check the original paper [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.5602) for details on how it works!\n",
    "\n",
    "We can implement DQN (and in general, neural network based Machine Learning + RL algorithms) easily in ```pytorch```. ```pytorch``` is one of the major frameworks used for this task (next to e.g. tensorflow!), so understanding how to use it is a good skill to have if you like ML!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part of the notebook, we use ```pytorch``` to implement DQN. Disclaimer: DQN is a fundamental, well-known algorithm. There are many implementations available online. Therefore, we largely use code from [this](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/reinforcement_q_learning.html) pytorch tutorial here. The purpose is simply to introduce you to ML/RL coding in ```pytorch```.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we include the pseudo-code of DQN, taken from the original paper (linked above), here. Take a look and compare it to the tabular Q-learning you used last week! The major differences here lie in the use of a replay memory to store observations in the form of tuples (state, action, next state, reward), that the model is trained on, and in the use of (two) neural networks to represent the policy, instead of a Q-table.\n",

    "\n",
    "An important challenge (and a very wide topic) in RL research is safety. In this part of the notebook, we look at two libraries that allow us to easily train save RL agents on suitable environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "[```safety_gymnasium```](https://safety-gymnasium.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) provides environments that include notions of costs and constraints. In our task, we will use the ```SafetyCarCircle1-v0``` environment - that means a safety environment, with a Car agent, for the Circle Task, Level 1. Check out the documentation on the Circle task [here](https://safety-gymnasium.readthedocs.io/en/latest/environments/safe_navigation/circle.html#circle1)!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Circle task, the agent learns to drive in circles around the center of a circled area. Level 0 does not implement any constraints, so it is not interesting to us here, but level 1 does! In level one, boundaries are implemented on two sides of the circle, and the agent needs to avoid crossing these boundaries. If it does, it is punished by receiving a cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the [```omnisafe```](https://www.omnisafe.ai/en/latest/index.html) library provides implementation of some DRL algorithms, like PPO, which we looked at in the previous section, as well as save versions of these algorithms. Here, we will use PPO, and the safe algorithm PPOLag, which implements Lagrangian constraints. Again, we do not need to understand this in detail for this notebook, but if you are interested, please read the omnisafe [documentation](https://www.omnisafe.ai/en/latest/benchmark/on-policy.html), and also consider the original papers of [PPO](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06347) and the Lagrangian version [PPOLag](https://cdn.openai.com/safexp-short.pdf)."

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file.

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.\n",
